everyone, my group cheyenne samia TIM and I are going to go over our strategies for promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake in rural parts of India.', 'our agenda for today, is as follows, we will first go through a brief introduction, followed by our motivation strategy or supply chain strategy or communication strategy, and then we will end off with a discussion of the effectiveness and sustainability of our recommended strategies.', ""So we'll start off with a quick introduction."", ""India is the second most populous country and it has been a vaccine development and manufacturing hub for corporate 19 however india's own vaccine rollout has not been sufficient as the percentage of the population fully vaccinated in India is just 32%."", 'Our group notice that rural states of India, had the least administered vaccine doses as of November 29 2021.', 'As can be seen from the graph jargon chapters got an awesome have the least amount of doses administered the rural population in jargon is 75.95% chapters go is 76.76% and our son is at 5.9%.', 'While rural states of India have physical distance relative isolation and lower population density in favor of them there are much less prepared to deal with the direct and indirect impacts of the crisis.', 'Of the 734 million extreme poor prior to the corporate 19 crisis 80% live in rural areas and this population has dramatically less access to adequate sanitation, health services, education, social protection and public infrastructure.', 'For these reasons, or group focused on effective strategies for promoting COVID 19 vaccine uptake in rural India.', 'So our motivational strategy has been created using past data from the polio vaccine campaign that was used in India during the polio eradication program in 1995.', 'The issues and factors that rural India was facing at that time or similar to those that it is facing now, which is why we believe our multi sectoral approach will be an effective strategy.', 'At the time of the polio eradication program rural India had high illiteracy rates did not have adequate resources and was impoverished a lot of which is relatively true to this day, hence we believe our motivational strategy will prove to be effective in the current covered 19 pandemic.', 'A mathematical modeling based analysis done by the Indian Council of medical research published by the British Medical Journal.', 'says that vaccination approaches that target vulnerable populations make for smarter public health choices, then do mass vaccination approaches.', 'The most important factor that we considered while creating our supply chain hotspot targeting strategy was the population of India.', 'In order for other strategies to be effective, it was crucial that we targeted our vaccination efforts to the most vulnerable sections of the country, which in this case is the rural population.', 'The study also mentioned that in the current situation where vaccine supply is insufficient in India and approach targeting the most vulnerable populations in India would reduce the overall health burden compared to a strategy with no vaccination and the complete lifting of restrictions.', 'Now, according to an article in the journal of global health, one of the reasons that may have caused an unsuccessful initial vaccine rollout was the requirement to register online for a time slot to receive the vaccine.', 'More than half the Indian population does not have access to the Internet, especially those living in rural areas, which made this approach unsuccessful.', ""Taking this initial attempt into account we've we've recommended or door to door approach, which we believe will be much more effective, given the situation in rural in rural parts of India."", 'While creating our communication strategy, we also considered the illiteracy rates in rural India.', 'We believe that using a door to door approach, especially by sending healthcare workers on this campaign will reduce vaccine hesitancy as these workers will be able to better educate rural citizens.', ""about the benefits of the vaccine and we'll be able to create a more personal touch making this a much more effective communication strategy than using a technology based approach."", ""We will now go over why our recommended strategies are effective, overall, and will help combat the issue of vaccine has didn't see within rural India."", 'So, according to a study dealing with vaccine hesitancy done by WHO sage working group in 2014.', 'The five interventions with the largest positive effect are those that directly target unvaccinated or under vaccinated populations.', 'aim to increase knowledge and awareness surrounding vaccination improve convenience and access to vaccination target specific populations and engage religious or other influential leaders to promote vaccination in the Community.', 'The strategies that we have recommended have all five of these interventions are strategies target the underdogs and native populations of rural India.', 'Through our communications strategy and collaboration of civil society and.', 'Community we aim to increase knowledge and awareness surrounding vaccination our door to door strategy helps improve convenience and access to vaccination.', 'Our hotspot strategy is built on targeting specific populations, which in this case, our rural populations, through our recommendation of the collaboration of civil society and community into English religious or other influential leaders to promote vaccination in the Community.', 'Sorry, could you repeat that question.', 'um yeah so.', 'A lot of our.', 'So one of the recommendations for that was based on the polio eradication was.', 'was because a lot of the situations in rural India are relatively the same not relative to the time then but relative to the urban population now.', 'So, which is why we thought the polio eradication program was a good one to use to compare it the strategy with because that was also a vaccination program that was.', ""That was done in this is also a vaccine program that we're trying to do, of course, there are changes in India, because you know as time changes development in the country."", 'You know, there is certain development in the country, but but to a couple with that with the data that we got from that.', 'study we have used other strategies as well, so that it was only used for our motivational strategy and then.', 'All the other strategies that we used our other two were not based on just the polio eradication program so.', ""Obviously, basing our research on just one research, study, it was not something that we went with because that doesn't give us an accurate picture of what's happening in the country right now."", 'That is why we used that as one of our strategies and then we had two others that coupled with it to give a nice overall picture.', 'I hope that answered your question.', 'So difference in the government from I mean I think those.', 'Those things we would obviously have to do a little bit more further research into the exact implementation and how much of that strategy, we can implement now, but as we mentioned, we have kind of tweak the strategy as well, for it to be more relevant to the current cold crisis so.', 'I think we would just have to do a little bit more, we would have to look more into the exact government, obviously we do know what the current government situation is, but for this relevant strategy, we would have to look into it a little bit more.', 'And then

addition to the motivational strategies and incentives, we recommend implementing a supply chain solution.', 'and communication strategy that targets, the underlying reasons for vaccine hesitancy.', 'These two strategies are related to to the key guidelines that we found any vaccinations strategy and one of our articles.', 'The first is deciding the order of which groups of the population, get the vaccine which is related to supply chain, and the second is reducing hesitancy and creating demand for the vaccine which we will do through communication.', 'This will be done by targeting the anti vaccination and misinformation groups which can reduce levels of vaccination.', 'So these groups will be actually considered competition and the two relevant types will be passive competition in the form of inaccurate media coverage and competition in the form of structural and economic factors.', 'So, in terms of the supply chain solution, we want to take a targeted approach which prioritises vaccinating rural areas, since they have a higher rate of infection.', 'These regions can be considered hotspots and according to one of our articles, this approach has been proven to have a modest benefit over non targeted vaccination strategies.', 'The article supporting this was based on a study that was conducted for the adult tuberculosis vaccine in Gujarat India.', ""So there's several quality issue qualitative issues which are not discussed in the article and then, since these are rural areas with lower income."", 'The people infected in these regions have limited access to healthcare, compared to those in more wealthy urban areas, they also utilize public health care, whereas urban areas have more private healthcare institutions which are known to have a higher quality of services.', ' 'Communication technological communication cannot be used as effectively to raise awareness of vaccination in rural areas.', 'Therefore, we recommend using a door to door campaign approach which has been shown to increase the rates of vaccines administered.', 'The article We selected covers the cholera of vaccine in a mass vaccination campaign was MB.', 'The results are based on the vaccine coverage used in that area and the survey results were positive.', 'Finding that out of half the people that did not take the vaccine, it was simply due to their absence, otherwise they were able to get 70% of people one dose.', 'Rural areas of a history of being provided with less government resources, so in order to compensate for this many charitable organizations have helped with various initiatives in the absence of the government.', 'Another article We selected investigates the vaccination attitudes in lower income countries were COVID 19 vaccination has not gone as for.', ""The findings from this article are transferable to rural regions in India, because, according to the data there's a disparity amongst regions and the lower income regions do not have the same levels of population vaccinated."", 'which is in line with India situation, the study found that the concern for side effects was the most common reason for vaccination hesitancy.', 'It also indicated that healthcare workers are the most trusted source of vaccine guidance.', 'Healthcare workers are more likely to have the vaccine themselves so populations may be more receptive if they are actually involved in the door to door campaign.', 'One key aspect in communication is to do it in isolation of misinformation because repeating the misinformation could actually do more harm than good.', 'is not advisable to directly engage with the competition that we mentioned earlier, but instead focus on positive messaging which can emphasize protecting oneself and community.', 'Therefore addition work with governments, NGOs, communities and the for profit sector to establish a convenient and widespread network which we included in other parts of our strategy.', 'To conclude, by implementing our recommendations for the vaccine motivation.', 'Supply Chain and communication, we believe that the rural regions in India will benefit greatly and see an increase in the rate of vaccination.', 'We would like to thank everyone for their time and we hope that our recommendations can be used to make a difference in India, we also like to open the floor now to any questions.', 'Go ahead yeah yeah go ahead.', ""So the question was in regards to like how many doses leave administer so forth, and whether or not yeah that's right, I think I read it's about 1 billion."", 'yeah so in regards to that

measures and rationale, along with the sustainability, we will also introduce our second strategy where we will compare both leading to our recommendation.', ' Upon gathering research and discussing information delivered by the Tasmania students, my group has identified two strategies to deal with vaccine has a tendency in Sri Lanka.', ' According to the World Health Organization about 70% of the population must be vaccinated to break the chain of transmission.', ' Since only about 60% of the Sri Lankan population is fully vaccinated, we believe that educating them on the importance of herd immunity will decrease vaccine has Tennessee.', ' With an increase in vaccine has a tendency rates she like those health officials suspect that and organized as misinformation campaign is behind the increase in vaccine has intensity and we must combat this misinformation.', ' According to an article by Wilson this information presented through social media is associated with declines in the vaccination rates.', ' This is what is currently happening in Sri Lanka, right now, social media is playing a major role as there is an increase in public belief that vaccines are unsafe.', ' Therefore, in order to reduce the vaccine hesitancy we must address this and correct the misinformation circulating in the media.', ' We will now discuss our first strategy of different methods to motivate the general population of Canada to get vaccinated.', ' Our initial strategy is a marketing strategy that involves government sponsored advertisements displayed on different mediums such as newspapers radios TV and social media.', ' A crucial component of this strategy is that actual content and themes of the ads well, I will all promote getting vaccinated they will achieve this through two main things planning Community protection and authority advice.', ' Planning Community protections add, such as these will focus on communicating the message that getting vaccinated is necessary to protect loved ones and the larger community.', ' On the other hand, covid 19 ad such as this one will leverage figures of authority and credibility, for example, licensed medical workers or government officials to promote getting vaccinated.', ' Lastly, our strategy will reduce boxing nation has a tendency due to misinformation, by providing accurate information regarding vaccination through centralized platforms, like a government website, along with this, a link to this website will be included in every ad in the campaign.', ' Although there is no research on vaccination advertising campaigns in Sri Lanka, specifically, they have been utilized to increase vaccination rates and many other countries, including the US, the UK and right here in Canada.', ' Sources show that such strategies are indeed effective with rates increasing by as much as 5% following the Ad campaign in the US.', ' Although using vaccination rates as a measure it does have its limitations, as people get vaccinated daily the vaccination rate changes so therefore since measure, since this measure is only an estimate for a single point at time.', ' Vaccination rates are also affected by many factors other than ad campaigns such as physical barriers, and therefore we cannot just assume that changes in the vaccination rates are fully attributable.', ' To marketing strategies another obvious limitation is that this data is from another country other than Sri Lanka.', "" Which means that using ad campaigns may not have the same impact on the shrinking population, as it did in the countries that the studies took place i'll pass it on to Brian to explain why the strategy will be effective and sheila and because context."", ' To summarize, we have considered two.', ' strategies to reduce vaccination has a tendency and go smash.', "" Vaccination rates in Sri Lanka, while strategy one utilizes an ad campaign leveraging Sri lanka's cultural dimensions to reduce misinformation and motivate the general population to get vaccinated."", ' strategy to combines the interest of both countries to solve the Pfizer showed a shortage, causing hesitancy among the 20 to 29 age group.', ""

increasing the general vaccination rate in Sri Lanka, because the themes of the ads appeal to the cultural dimensions of Sri Lanka."", ' So there were six cultural value dimensions that were identified by social psychologists hofstede to serve as a framework in cross cultural comparisons and psychology business and communication.', ' Among the six collectivism and power distance are considered to have the most important implications for social behaviors.', ' collectivism refers to the preference tornado tightly knit social framework in which individuals are expected to give the group priority over individuals.', ' While power distance refers to the extent to which the less powerful individuals of the social structures expect and accept that power is not distributed equally.', ' Sri Lanka as a collectivist culture with a high power distance the themes in our proposed ad campaign therefore aim to leverage these factors for maximum effectiveness.', ' plan and Community protection as appeal to the collectivist culture of so Lanka, while authority advice as leverage the high power distance.', ' A cross sectional study by Lee at all on the influence of collectivism and power distance on the adoption of the influenza vaccine among Hong Kong they says provide solid support for a strategy.', ' They propose that the effect of cultural dimensions on bethany that seat destination adoption was mediated by social factors.', ' They propose mediation model is as follows, with collectivism being mediated by social benefits, such as protection motivation towards others.', ' And power distance being mediated by social influence such as acceptance of advice from others.', "" Through surveying Hong Kong nature's on these measures and analyzing the data they were able to find evidence for this mechanism."", ' As such, the researchers concluded that in countries with collectivist and high power distance culture, such as Hong Kong.', ' Vaccination promotion strategies that focus on the protection to it in group members, along with the use of authority figures are most effective.', ' However, even if we use ads that appeal to the cultural values of Sri Lanka, there are many factors that may influence the effectiveness of such a strategy.', ' Firstly, cultural values can change over time, meaning they can vary between age groups, this would translate to our strategy having inconsistent effects on different age groups.', ' For example, if younger generations are more individualistic or less compliant to authority our strategy would have less impact on the vaccination rates in the younger age groups and older ones.', ' Secondly, ad campaigns only take a psychological approach to increasing vaccination rates.', ' In factors other than a lack of motivation or awareness, such as physical or legal barriers are the key reasons behind vaccine hesitancy for certain groups of people, the effectiveness of our strategy would be greatly hampered.', ' While ads are relatively easy to run the long term sustainability of the strategy is dependent on a myriad of factors.', ' To maximize the effectiveness of each advertisement and adapt to changes the government or a marketing agency should consistently measure at engagement and effectiveness.', ' This can be achieved by linking add engagement levels for certain groups to corresponding changes to their in their respective vaccination rates.', ' To further bolster the advantages of the strategy, the government can partner with a marketing agency to explore the use of targeted ads.', ' This means tailoring as that account for differences in the audience, such as habits lifestyles and preferences to maximize engagement and effectiveness.', '
